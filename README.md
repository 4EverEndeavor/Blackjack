# Blackjack
Card-counting simulator 
This program is for desiging, testing and comparing card counting strategies for blackjack.
Once a desired strategy has been chosen, a command interface provides a simulated game, 
with structured feedback. The player must make the correct decisions, and bet sizes. 

Perhaps the best feature of this program is testing two different counting strategies on 
the same deck. That is, the order of the deck is preserved for both strategies in a side-
by-side comparison. Then the deck is shuffled.
